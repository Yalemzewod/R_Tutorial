## R and Rstudio ?

R?

:   A free statistical software used in data analysis and data science. It's especially powerful for performing advanced statistical computing and creating compelling plots.

    In simpler words, it's like a toolbox for working with data, where you can perform various tasks related to data analysis and visualization.

    -   Free and open sources

    -   Large supportive community - [Stack overflow](https://stackoverflow.co/)

    -   Flexiable and user friendly - over 18,000 packages

Rstudio?

:   A user-friendly interface for programming in R - a graphical front-end that makes it easier to work with R.

    R studio offers:

    -   User-friendly Interface - four panel

    -   Reusable scripts - write and save reusable script

    -   Data and object management - easily access all the imported data and created objects

    -   Project Organization

    -   Plot previewing

## Why should you learn R?

-   Learning R equips you with statistical skills, visualization skills, and a chance to exciting career opportunities. Whether you're a data enthusiast or a seasoned programmer, R is worth exploring

## Installing R

To start working in Rstudio, we need to first download and install the R programming language. Installing R and RStudio is straightforward. Let's walk through the steps:

Once you've completed these steps, RStudio should be successfully installed on your Windows system, and you can start using it for your data analysis and programming tasks. ***Well done! Let's explore RStudio in panels.***

## Introduction to RStudio.

**Common features**

Once you open files, you will see three panels: Console, Environment and Output.

**Console**:

-   The console pane is where we interact with R directly.

-   We can type and execute R commands here, and it displays the output of those commands.

-   It's a powerful tool for testing code snippets, exploring data, and debugging.

**Environment pane**:

-   The **`Environment`** tab shows your loaded variables and their values.

    ![](environment.png)

**Output pane**:

-   **`Files`**: Displays your project files and directories.

-   **`Plots`**: Shows graphical plots generated by R.

-   **`Packages`**: Lists installed R packages.

-   **`Help`**: Provides access to R documentation.

-   **`Viewer`**: Displays HTML content.

-   **`Presentation`**: Useful for creating slideshows or presentations.

![](file_output.png)

**Source pane**:

-   This is the top-left panel to view and edit various code-related files.

-   It allows us to work with files like `.R, .rmd, .qmd, .py, .css`, or general text files such as `.txt or .md`.

-   Each additional file you open will appear as a new tab within the Source panel.

**The RStudio Project**

-   It's good practice to create an RStudio Project when performing data analysis. This allows you to organise your projects into different tasks or context. Each project has their own working directory, workspace, history and scripts.

How to create a project ?

1\. Click on File \> New Project

2.  Click on New Directory \> Empty Project

3\. Type in a name for your project directory, e.g. Intro_to_R_project

4\. Click on Create Project

**Customize the user interface**

RStudio support customizing the layout of the panels and the user interface.

How to customizing the appearance of the user interface?

1.  Click on Tools \> Global Options
2.  Click on Appearance \> Editor fonts, Editor font size

Customizing the layout of the panels

1.  Click on Tools \> Global Options
2.  Click on Pane Layout \> move the position
